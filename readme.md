# Mini-project 2

## Overview

The goal of this miniproject is to find and acquire data. Ideally, you should be able to use (some of) these data for the next data visualization project. 

---

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

 - Come up with a research question and some corresponding hypotheses. 
 - Find data with which you might be able to answer your question. 
 - In total, you will have to find data using the following three sources:
    - A csv/excel sheet from the internet (e.g. Kaggle/Google/ML Repository etc.). 
    - API.
    - Raw HTML (web scraping). 
 - The data must be stored in your local database (not just as comma separated files!). 
 - The data should be clean and ready to use. 

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be prepared and submitted

- **A project repository** with a functional structure (data_folder, code_folder, git_ignore file, Readme.md file). This repository will be used also for your visualization project.
- **A Jupyter notebook** containing the basic cleaning procedures and a link to your local database/data. 
- **A data_folder** with a Readme file inside that explains the data sets. If the data you are using weight more than a few Megabytes, it is good practice to place the data on Gdrive or somewhere else on the cloud. In this case the Readme file in the data_folder should also contain a link to the data, to be downloaded and used locally. It is also a good practice to use relative paths in the Jupyter/Python files to access the data. 

## Resources and suggestions

* **Find a data set to process** <br>
Great places to start looking would be <br>
[Awesome Public Data Sets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)<br> 
[Kaggle Data Sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)<br>
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)<br> 
[Open data van de Overheid](https://data.overheid.nl/) <br>
A great new source is the <br> [Google dataset search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch)<br>
* **Resources for Markdown in Jupyter** <br>
    * [Short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBCB23pQeIA)
    * [Article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-jupyter-notebook-formatting-guide-873ab39f765e)
    * You may also find inspiration from the Jupyter notebooks you have worked on for your labs
    

## Useful questions to ask yourself

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you incorporate domain knowledge or unique perspective into your analysis

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class?


This will be useful as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are described in the specs above__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

## Presentation Guideline and Criteria

You will present your mini project on Saturday, May 15th. 

### Format

* Presentation Time: 10 minutes max
* Q & A: 5 minutes
* **Total Time:** 15 minutes

### Outputs

* Present your findings using the Jupyter notebook you have developed, **no slides and no power point presentation**
* Be prepared to explain your entire notebook guiding us trough your thought process

### Things to talk about

* Introduction
  * Describe the datasets you chose
  * Why did you choose that dataset?
  * The most important thing you learned
* The code
    * Be prepared to explain your code as well as markdown comments 
* Challenges
    * What was the most challenging part about this miniproject?
